# Supermarket Sales and Weather Conditions - Reproducibility Challenge
Introduction to Research Skills - Assignment 4.1

## Description
The project is the continuation of Assignment 1 from the class introduction to research skills at EPFL. In Assignment 1 the topic of trying to link weather conditions to supermarket sales has been set. In this part of the Assignment, sales data from a fictional supermarket in Lausanne is imported as well as weather data from Lausanne in March and April 2021. The sales data contains information on the sales of carrots, ice cream and coffee to go. The weather data contains information on the temperature during the day as well as whether or not in rained on the given day. 

The sales and the weather data is imported from two seperate Excel sheets and then the data is plotted separately. Afterwards, two plots are made where the weather (temperature and rain) and ice cream sales are plotted together and in the second one the weather is plotted together with the coffee to go sales data. This way, possible correlation can be examined visually in a first step.

The next step would be to further look into the correlations between weather and sales of different products. Since this code is done for learning to code and document in a reproducible way, the code was not developed further. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any computer that can run Matlab is required.
* Alternatively, the Matlab Online Version can be used.

### Installing 

* In order to use the Matlab Online Version, it is sufficient to login with a Mathworks account at https://matlab.mathworks.com/ 

### Executing Program

* The Excel files provided need to be in the same folder as the main script in order for the script to find them.
* Afterwards, the whole code can be run either by clicking on the button on top of the page or by using the following command in the command window:

```
run("Assignment4_1_main.m")
```
