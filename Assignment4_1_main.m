% Content: Reading in Sales data from a fictional supermarket in Lausanne
% as well as weather data from Lausanne and plotting figures to viualize 
% the data and visually see potential correlation.
% The sales data have been artificially generated for the sake of this
% assignment, since real data has not been found.
% The weather data is taken from www.historique-meteo.net
